    <h5 class="text success text capitalize"> was established in 1970</h5>
    <p class="text muted"> Walden was established in 1970 by two New York teachers, 
      Bernie and Rita Turner, who created a program for working adults/teachers to pursue doctoral degrees. 
      In the summer of 1971, the first classes took place in Naples, 
      Florida, 
      focusing primarily on school administrators. 
      The initial classes allowed students to form dissertation topics with their faculty partners before 
      returning to work at their respective schools while completing their dissertations. 
      In 1972, 
      Walden conferred its first degrees: 
      46 PhDs and 24 EdDs at its first commencement in Naples.</p>

    <p class="text muted">The Richard W. Riley College of Education, the 
      premier college of education in South Carolina and an 
      established leader in the region and the nation, has a 
      long and successful history of preparing teachers and 
      leaders for work in and beyond schools. 
      That tradition 
      of excellence continues today as it prepares students 
      to engage in careers in education, human science, 
      leadership, sports, health, and technology.</p>

      <h5 class="text success text capitalize">It was established in 1981</h5>
      <p class="text muted">The Council was established in 1981 in order to set standards for counselor training. 
        The first national conference was held from 7 to 10 October 1988 in St. Louis. 
        The Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES) and the American Personnel and Guidance Association
         (a precursor to the American Counselor Association) discussed cooperative accreditation efforts for counseling 
         programs. 
        This ultimately led to CACREP's establishment.

        CACREP serves as one of the four major entities of the counseling profession in the United States; 
        the other three entities are the American Counseling Association the National Board of Certified Counselors and 
        the American Mental Health Counselors Association.</p>
